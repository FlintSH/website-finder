# website finder 🔍

A tool that helps you discover websites based on keywords. I made this because when I'm bored I like to find niche sites, and google really sucks at that.

## What it does

- Searches every single TLD for your keyword
- Returns back all live websites with a screenshot preview of each
- Returns back any domains that might be available if you want to buy them
- Can help you discover available domains

That's it. Can't be asked to add a license, do whatever you want.
